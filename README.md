## Core Script

**Opener**  
“Hello, my name is **[NAME]**. Quick question: would you consider selling the property at **[ADDRESS]**, or probably not right now?”  
→ If they ask who you are: [Who is this?](#who-is-this)  
→ If they ask how you got the number: [How did you get my number?](#how-did-you-get-my-number)  
→ If they question your role: [Are you the buyer?](#are-you-the-buyer) or [Are you an agent?](#are-you-an-agent)

**If ‘No’**  
“No problem. I’ll note it.” → [Not interested.](#not-interested)

**If ‘Maybe’ or ‘Yes’**  
“Got it. Quick three things so I don’t waste your time:”  
1) “What’s got you open to selling?” → If retail talk: [I want top dollar / retail.](#i-want-top-dollar--retail)  
2) “What timing would work for you?” → If urgent: [Can you close fast?](#can-you-close-fast)  
3) “Any repairs or issues I should know about?” → If as‑is: [As‑is / repairs?](#as-is--repairs)  
4) *Only if it feels natural:* “If everything else made sense, any ballpark you’d feel okay with?” → If pushback: [Just send me an offer.](#just-send-me-an-offer)

**Close**  
“Perfect. I’ll review this and follow up with next steps. What’s a good **general time window** to reconnect **[day/time range]**? Is this the best number?”  
If they prefer text/email: [Text or email me.](#text-or-email-me)

---

## If Answer: Branching

- **No →** Thank them. Offer removal if they want. → [Remove me / DNC.](#remove-me--dnc)  
- **Maybe/Yes →** Ask the 3 core questions. If they resist price, skip it and close.  
- **Hostile →** “All good. I’ll let you go.” End.  
- **Gatekeeper →** “Thanks. Is there a better number or time for the owner?” If none, end.
