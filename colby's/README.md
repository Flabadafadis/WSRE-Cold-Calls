* Time chosen → [Close the call](#close-the-call)
* Needs different time → [Schedule callback](#schedule-callback)
  [⬆ Back to Start](#start)

---

## Price handling

Use only if asked about price before the appointment, or at the end once the appointment is set.

**Deflect early:**

* “Price depends on condition, timeline, and risk. We buy as-is, cover most closing costs, and move fast. Let’s see the basics first so we don’t guess wrong.”
* If they insist on a number → “We’re investors, so it’s below retail. After a quick look we can give a firm number.”

**Transparency after scheduling (optional):**

* “Before we meet, quick heads-up on our model so there are no surprises: we typically target about **60% of the updated value**, adjusted for repairs, liens, holding, and risk. If that ballpark doesn’t work, tell me now and we won’t waste your time.”
* If rejected → [Realtor check](#realtor-check) or [Schedule callback](#schedule-callback)
  [⬆ Back to Start](#start)

## Close the call

**Locked for [day/time]. We’ll text to confirm. No prep needed. Be ready to chat a few minutes. We’ll try to get an offer signed if it fits.**
*(Ensure all decision makers attend.)*

* Confirmed → End
* Not confirmed → [Schedule callback](#schedule-callback)
