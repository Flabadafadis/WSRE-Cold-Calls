## Core Script

**Opener**  
“Hey **[FIRST NAME]**, it’s **Jared**. I work with a licensed agent. I’m looking to buy near **[NEIGHBORHOOD]**. Any chance you’d consider selling **[ADDRESS]**, or probably not right now?”

**If ‘No’**  
“All good. I’ll note it. Have a good one.” → **Disposition:** Not Interested / DNC if asked.

**If ‘Maybe’ or ‘Yes’**  
“Cool. Super quick so I don’t waste your time:”  
1) “What’s got you open to selling?”  
2) “What kind of timing would work for you?”  
3) “Any repairs or issues I should know about?”  
4) “Is it lived‑in or vacant?”  
5) *Only if it feels natural:* “If everything else made sense, what ballpark would you feel good about?”

**Close**  
“Perfect. I’ll look this over and circle back. What’s a good **general time window** to reconnect **[day/time range]**? And this is the best number, right?”  
“Awesome. Talk then.”

## If Answer: Branching

- **No →** Thank them. Mark Not Interested or DNC if they say so. End.  
- **Maybe/Yes →** Ask the bullets above. If they resist price, skip it and go to close.  
- **Hostile →** “No worries. I’ll let you go.” End.  
- **Gatekeeper →** “Got it. Is there a better number or time for the owner?” If none, end.

## Questions/Concerns and Responses

### How did you get my number?
“Public and marketing records tied to **[ADDRESS]**.”

### Are you an agent?
“I’m not. I work with a licensed agent. I’m calling as a buyer.”

### Just send me an offer.
“Happy to after a quick look. I’ll confirm basics and get back to you at **[WINDOW]**.”

### I want top dollar / retail.
“Totally fair. I focus on a simple, fast sale. If retail is the goal, listing might be better. If convenience matters more, we might be a fit.”

### Not interested.
“Understood. Want me to remove you, or check back at a better time of year?”

### Busy. Call later.
“No problem. What **general window** works **[today/tomorrow, morning/afternoon/evening]**? I’ll keep it quick.”

### Text or email me.
“Sure. I’ll send a short recap and our time window.”

### Fees / closing costs?
“We keep it simple. We can cover standard closing costs. No fees to you.”

### As‑is / repairs?
“As‑is is fine. Just need headline issues so I plan right.”

### Tenants in place.
“Okay. Month‑to‑month or lease? What’s the rent? I can work with tenants.”

### Can you close fast?
“Yes. If access and numbers check out, we can move quickly.”

### How do you value it?
“Recent sales, condition, and your timing. I’ll review and follow up with next steps.”

### Is this a scam?
“I get the caution. I’ll keep it short now and follow up at **[WINDOW]** so you can decide.”

### I’ll just list it.
“If maximizing price is #1, listing is smart. If you want speed and less hassle, I may be better. Your call.”
